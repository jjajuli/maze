# Invisible Maze (Tkinter)

A minimal puzzle game built with Python’s `tkinter`. Players navigate from a start cell to a goal cell on a grid where the valid path is invisible. Stepping off the path causes a “fall” and resets the player to the start. A toggle can reveal the path for practice or debugging. Mazes can be generated randomly or loaded from a JSON file.

## Features

- Random path generation using depth-first search (DFS) with a safe L-shape fallback.  
- Optional **Show path** checkbox for learning or debugging.  
- Keyboard controls with arrows or WASD.  
- Tracks total falls for the current run.  
- Load custom mazes from JSON (dimensions, start/goal, and explicit path).  
- Simple, dependency-free UI using the standard library (`tkinter`, `json`, `os`, `random`).

## How it works

- The board is a rectangular grid. By default it is 7×7 with 36-pixel cells and a small canvas margin.  
- A valid path from `start` to `goal` is generated by `generate_path_random()` via `_dfs_path(...)`.  
  If DFS fails after several attempts, the game falls back to a simple L-shaped route.  
- The player begins at `start`. Moving onto any cell not in the path registers a fall, flashes the cell briefly, increments the fall counter, and resets the player to `start`.  
- Reaching `goal` shows a win dialog and then either reloads the same loaded maze (if playing a file) or generates a fresh random maze.

## Controls

- Movement: **↑ ↓ ← →** or **W S A D**  
- UI:
  - **Show path**: toggles visibility of the hidden path.  
  - **New Random Maze**: creates a fresh randomized path with the current board size.  
  - **Restart (from start)**: moves the player back to the start without changing the maze.  
  - **Load Maze**: opens a JSON file dialog (defaults to a local `paths` folder if present).
